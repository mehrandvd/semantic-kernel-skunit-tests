# SCENARIO CSharpStory

## PARAMETER input

During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a managed code compiler system called "Simple Managed C" (SMC).[22][23] In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-like Object Oriented Language".[24] Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.

Hejlsberg is C#'s principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft, and was previously involved with the design of Turbo Pascal, Embarcadero Delphi (formerly CodeGear Delphi, Inprise Delphi and Borland Delphi), and Visual J++. In interviews and technical papers he has stated that flaws[25] in most major programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, Delphi, and Smalltalk) drove the fundamentals of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which, in turn, drove the design of the C# language itself.

James Gosling, who created the Java programming language in 1994, and Bill Joy, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, the originator of Java, called C# an "imitation" of Java; Gosling further said that "[C# is] sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted."[26][27] In July 2000, Hejlsberg said that C# is "not a Java clone" and is "much closer to C++" in its design.[28]

Since the release of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java languages have evolved on increasingly divergent trajectories, becoming two quite different languages. One of the first major departures came with the addition of generics to both languages, with vastly different implementations. C# makes use of reification to provide "first-class" generic objects that can be used like any other class, with code generation performed at class-load time.[29] Furthermore, C# has added several major features to accommodate functional-style programming, culminating in the LINQ extensions released with C# 3.0 and its supporting framework of lambda expressions, extension methods, and anonymous types.[30] These features enable C# programmers to use functional programming techniques, such as closures, when it is advantageous to their application. The LINQ extensions and the functional imports help developers reduce the amount of boilerplate code that is included in common tasks like querying a database, parsing an xml file, or searching through a data structure, shifting the emphasis onto the actual program logic to help improve readability and maintainability.[31]

C# used to have a mascot called Andy (named after Anders Hejlsberg). It was retired on January 29, 2004.[32]

C# was originally submitted to the ISO/IEC JTC 1 subcommittee SC 22 for review,[33] under ISO/IEC 23270:2003,[34] was withdrawn and was then approved under ISO/IEC 23270:2006.[35] The 23270:2006 is withdrawn under 23270:2018 and approved with this version.[36]
## ANSWER
The .NET Framework originally used a managed code compiler system called "Simple Managed C" (SMC, but later the class libraries and ASP.NET runtime were ported to C#. C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg, who was also involved in the design of Turbo Pascal, Embarcadero Delphi, and Visual J++. C# has been compared to Java, with some calling it an "imitation" of Java, while others argue that it is closer to C++. Since the release of C# 2.0 in 2005, C# and Java have evolved on increasingly divergent trajectories, with C# adding features like generics and functional-style programming. C# was submitted to the ISO/IEC for review and was approved under ISO/IEC 23270:2006.
